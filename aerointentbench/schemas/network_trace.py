"""Deterministic network traces and the single network measurement a policy may see.

This module owns the trace *data*: parsing, validation, and the observation type. The
lookup behaviour that turns a time into an observation is a simulation concern and lives
in ``aerointentbench.simulator.network_trace`` behind the ``NetworkModel`` protocol, so a
future recorded-trace or live-network model can replace it without touching this schema.

The full trace is simulator-internal. A policy observes only the current
:class:`NetworkObservation`; exposing the future trace would let a policy pre-empt a
degradation it has no way of knowing about, which is precisely what the benchmark tests.
