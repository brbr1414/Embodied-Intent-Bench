"""Predefined flight path.

V1 evaluates configuration selection, not navigation, so a path is reduced to the one
property the benchmark actually consumes: how far the vehicle must travel. Combined with
the episode's fixed velocity that yields ``path_progress``, which drives the primary
termination condition.

Waypoints, altitude profiles, and turn dynamics are deliberately absent. They would imply
a flight model V1 does not have, and nothing in the decision loop would read them.
