"""The policy-visible observation.

``RuntimeState`` is the **entire** boundary between the simulator and a policy. It is
constructed fresh by the runner at every decision step and is frozen, so a policy can
neither retain a mutable handle on simulator state nor influence the run except through
its returned configuration ID.

What must never appear here
---------------------------
Any ground-truth-derived quantity: true recall, the hidden target count, whether a
prediction actually matched. Any future knowledge: the remainder of the network trace,
upcoming frames. Any simulator handle: the ``Episode``, the runner, the energy ledger.

A leak here does not produce a wrong number -- it silently invalidates every result the
benchmark reports, because the policy would be scored on information no deployed system
could have. ``tests/test_runtime_state.py`` pins the exact field set for that reason.
