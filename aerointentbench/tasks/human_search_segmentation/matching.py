"""Deterministic one-to-one matching of predicted masks to ground-truth masks.

For one frame: compute the IoU of every prediction against every ground-truth instance, keep
the pairs that clear the task's matching rule, then assign greedily -- the highest-IoU
admissible pair first, then the next, with each prediction and each ground-truth instance
used at most once. What is left over is unmatched: a prediction that matched nothing is a
false positive, a ground-truth instance that nothing matched is a miss.

Greedy, not optimal
-------------------
This is greedy assignment, not the globally optimal (Hungarian) assignment. V1 has no array
or ``scipy`` dependency, and for the handful of instances in one UAV frame greedy and optimal
disagree only under deliberately arranged overlaps -- a strong prediction next to a weak one
both eyeing two targets. The case is contrived for aerial human search; the limitation is
recorded here and its tie-breaking is pinned by a test.

Determinism
-----------
Candidates are ordered by a total key -- IoU descending, then ``prediction_id`` ascending,
then ``track_id`` ascending -- so equal-IoU ties resolve the same way on every machine and
the result never depends on set or dict iteration order.
