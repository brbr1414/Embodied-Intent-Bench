"""A hand-written heuristic baseline.

**Not optimal, and not claimed to be.** It is a readable reference point that consults every
signal the contract makes binding, so that a learned or optimisation-based policy has
something meaningful to beat.

The rule, in order. Each step narrows the candidates; the last one that leaves anything
standing decides.

1. **Privacy.** Drop configurations the contract forbids. Selecting one would be recorded as
   a violation, and a baseline should not spend its budget on those.
2. **Reachability.** Drop remote configurations while the link is dead. They would fail,
   costing a timeout and producing nothing.
3. **Communication budget.** Drop configurations whose upload would breach the remaining
   budget, keeping a reserve so the last steps are not left with no legal option.
4. **Deadline pressure.** If the mission is projected to overrun, keep only the fastest
   candidates -- quality is worthless if the contract's deadline fails.
5. **Battery pressure.** Near the required reserve, prefer the fastest candidate. Latency is
   a proxy here: public profiles disclose no energy, and a longer inference means more time
   airborne. Weak, and deliberately so -- see docs/v1_spec.md §10b on why battery is a guard.
6. **Latency budget.** Drop candidates whose estimated latency exceeds a multiple of the
   decision interval, *if any candidate survives*. This is what makes the policy abandon a
   remote configuration as bandwidth collapses: at 2 Mbps one upload spans six frames, and
   every skipped frame is a target that may never be seen again.
7. **Quality.** Among what remains, take the highest quality tier, breaking ties toward
   lower estimated latency.

Without public profiles the policy still runs: steps 1-4 need no profile, and step 7 falls
back to catalog order. It degrades rather than failing, because whether profiles are
disclosed is a property of the run, not something a policy may assume.
