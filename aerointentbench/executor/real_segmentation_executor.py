"""Interface stub for executing a real segmentation model.

**Not implemented, and deliberately so.** V1 must run on CPU with zero runtime dependencies;
importing a model framework here would make every benchmark run depend on a GPU stack to
measure a decision policy that does not need one.

The stub exists to fix the seam. Everything a real backend needs is already in
``ExecutionRequest``, and everything it must return is already in ``ExecutionResult``, so
adding one later is a new module plus a registry entry -- not a change to the runner, the
metrics, or any policy.

How this would be implemented
-----------------------------
1. **Optional dependency.** Declare the model stack under an extra
   (``pip install aerointentbench[segmentation]``) and import it inside ``execute``, so the
   base package keeps its zero-dependency guarantee.
2. **Model resolution.** Map ``configuration.model_id`` to weights through a model registry
   populated from a configuration file -- never by parsing the ID string.
3. **Strategy application.** ``strategy.precision`` selects the quantised variant;
   ``strategy.input_compression`` is applied before a remote transfer;
   ``strategy.parameters`` carries future dimensions such as input resolution or an
   early-exit index.
4. **Measurement.** Time the inference and read energy from a platform power sensor, then
   report both in the result. A profile then becomes a *recording* of these runs rather
   than a hand-authored fixture -- which is the point of keeping the two separable.
5. **Placement.** A local backend runs in-process. A remote backend posts to a service
   endpoint and must map transport failures onto ``FailureReason`` rather than raising,
   because a failed inference is a benchmark condition, not a crash.
6. **Determinism.** Real inference is not reproducible across hardware. Such runs are for
   *collecting* replay record sets; scored benchmark runs should replay them, so results
   stay comparable across machines.

    configuration error to fix, not a mission condition to measure, and quietly reporting
    "inference failed" for every frame would look like a benchmark result.
