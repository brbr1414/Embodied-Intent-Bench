"""The execution interface: what is asked of a backend, and what it returns.

The benchmark separates three things that are easy to conflate:

1. **what** configuration was selected -- a ``Configuration``,
2. **how** it is executed -- an :class:`Executor` implementation,
3. **what result** it produced -- an :class:`ExecutionResult`.

The runner must work identically whether a result came from a synthetic profile, a
precomputed prediction, a real local model, a remote server, or a future split-inference
runtime. Everything backend-specific stays behind this interface.

Predictions are deliberately opaque here. Their shape is a property of the *task* -- an
instance mask set for human search, boxes for detection -- and an executor that understood
them would have to grow a branch per task. The task's evidence tracker interprets the
payload; the executor and the runner only carry it.
