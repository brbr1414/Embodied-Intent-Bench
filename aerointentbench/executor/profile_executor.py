"""Profile-driven execution: costs come from a per-platform profile, not from real work.

This is the V1 default. It needs no GPU, no model weights, and no network, and it is exactly
reproducible -- the same request always yields the same result.

Placement drives the cost model, read from typed strategy metadata:

- **local**: latency is the profiled compute time; nothing is transmitted.
- **remote**: ``upload + RTT + server compute + download``, where transfer time depends on
  the bandwidth observed *at this instant*. This is the whole point of a remote
  configuration being available -- it turns a network condition into a mission cost.

Nothing here inspects ``config_id``. A configuration is remote because
``strategy.placement`` says so.
