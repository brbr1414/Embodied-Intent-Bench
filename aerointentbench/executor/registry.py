"""The executor registry, and the context its factories are built from.

Lets the composition root pick a backend by name -- ``--executor replay`` -- without the
runner importing any backend, and lets a new backend join by registering itself rather than
by editing a branch somewhere in the core.

Why a context object
--------------------
The registry previously held the executor *classes*, whose constructors take different
arguments: ``ProfileExecutor(profiles, ...)`` against ``make_replay_executor(path, ...)``.
There was no uniform ``create(name, ...)`` call, so nothing could dispatch through it and it
served only to print help text. Giving every factory the same signature --
``(ExecutorContext) -> Executor`` -- is what turns the registry into a real construction
path.

The context carries everything any backend might need. A factory that does not need a field
ignores it; a factory whose field is missing raises with an explanation rather than
substituting a different backend, because a run that silently changed executor mid-selection
would report a provenance it did not have.
