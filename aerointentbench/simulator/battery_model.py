"""Battery state, energy accounting, and the battery transition model.

Energy is tracked in **joules** internally and converted to a fraction only for reporting
and constraint checks. Working in fractions would make the arithmetic depend on the
platform's capacity, so two platforms could not share a transition model.

The three energy components -- flight, compute, communication -- are tracked separately
throughout, because the benchmark reports them separately and because a policy's whole
job is trading compute and communication against a budget that flight is also draining.
