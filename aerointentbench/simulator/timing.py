"""Decision-loop timing.

V1 runs one decision per second over a nominal one-frame-per-second stream, with at most
one inference in flight. Those two rules together decide what happens when inference is
slower than the interval, and the answer has to be exact: it determines how many frames an
expensive configuration costs the mission, which is most of what the benchmark measures.

The rules, stated once here rather than scattered as constants:

- A step lasts ``max(decision_interval_s, inference_latency_s)``. The interval is a floor,
  not a budget.
- No second inference starts while one is running, so a slow configuration does not
  overlap its successor -- it delays it.
- The frame index is the wall clock quantised to the frame interval. Frames that elapse
  during a long inference are simply never seen; that dropped work is the cost being
  modelled, not an error.
