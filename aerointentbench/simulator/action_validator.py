"""Validation of the configuration a policy selected.

A policy is the subject under evaluation, so it is treated as untrusted input. It may name
a configuration that does not exist, one the episode disallows, one the contract's privacy
level forbids, or something that is not a configuration ID at all. None of that may end the
run: an episode that crashed on a bad action would report nothing, when what the benchmark
wants to report is precisely that the policy behaved badly.

So an invalid action is recorded and replaced, never raised:

1. Keep the current configuration if there is one and it is still acceptable.
2. Otherwise use the configured safe fallback.

A privacy-violating selection is *blocked*, not executed and then penalised. The simulator
must not model data leaving the vehicle in violation of its contract even hypothetically;
the attempt is recorded, and the episode's privacy constraint fails on the record.
