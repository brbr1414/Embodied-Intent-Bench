"""Episode termination conditions.

Three conditions end a V1 episode: the path is flown, the deadline passes, or the battery
empties. Each is a separate object so a future condition -- a geofence, an abort signal --
is an addition rather than another branch inside the runner.

A failed remote inference is deliberately *not* a termination condition. Losing the network
is a situation the policy is supposed to handle, not a reason to stop measuring how it
handles it.
