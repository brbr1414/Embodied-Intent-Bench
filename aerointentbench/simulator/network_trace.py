"""Network observation model.

Owns the *behaviour* of turning a time into an observation; the trace data and its
validation live in ``aerointentbench.schemas.network_trace``. A future recorded-network or
live model implements :class:`NetworkModel` and drops in unchanged.

The model holds the whole trace. The runner asks it for the observation at the current
time and puts only that single observation into the ``RuntimeState``. A policy that could
see the remaining trace would pre-empt degradations it has no way of knowing about, which
is exactly the adaptation the benchmark is trying to measure.
