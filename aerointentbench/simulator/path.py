"""Path progress model.

V1 flies a predefined path at a fixed nominal velocity, so progress is a function of
elapsed time alone. The vehicle keeps moving regardless of what the policy selects -- a
slow inference does not pause the aircraft, it just means fewer frames get processed over
the same ground.
