"""Structured records: what the runner emits, and what everything downstream reads.

Evaluators and metrics compute from records, never from live simulator state. That
separation is what lets a metric be added later without rerunning anything, provided the
step log already carried the data -- which is why the step log is generous rather than
minimal. Logging a field costs a dictionary entry; discovering it was needed after a
benchmark campaign costs the campaign.

The records are deliberately plain and JSON-serialisable. Nothing here interprets a
prediction payload or knows what task produced it.
