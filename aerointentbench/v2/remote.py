"""Simulated remote inference behind deployment-ready boundaries (V3 P1).

Remote execution is a distinct path with explicit stages —

    capture -> request encoding -> upload -> network transit -> remote compute
            -> response transit -> response decoding -> completion or failure

— never "a local executor with a bigger constant latency". The stages are computed
deterministically here, but they are kept architecturally separate so a later real
deployment can place them on real machines without touching the mission runner,
policies, or the evaluator:

    UAV / Jetson edge runtime          Remote inference service
      policy + local executors          request validation
      request encoding                  remote model execution
      network client (Transport) ─────► response encoding
      fallback handling          ◄─────
              │
              ▼
    Benchmark coordinator (this repo): scenario, runtime state, evidence,
    resource accounting, mission evaluation

Boundaries:

- :class:`InferenceTransport` — everything the *network* does. The simulated
  implementation computes stage times from the capture-time network snapshot
  (**Model A**: conditions are frozen at request submission; a regime change during a
  transfer does not affect it — documented, tested, and replaceable later by an
  interval-integrating transport behind the same protocol).
- :class:`RemoteInferenceBackend` — everything the *server* does. The simulated
  implementation runs an existing local model-strategy in-process.
- :class:`SimulatedRemoteExecutor` — the benchmark-facing executor. It conforms to the
  V2 result shape (`ImageExecutionResult`), charges communication volume and radio
  energy, and applies the fallback semantics.

Protocol models (`InferenceRequest`, transport results) are wire-representable: every
field is a JSON scalar/list, request ids are stable, and the payload travels as an
explicit reference plus metadata (a real transport would serialize the encoded bytes;
the in-process simulation passes the array alongside the request). ``PROTOCOL_VERSION``
stamps every request so a future client/server pair can negotiate.

Accounting rules (each tested):

- **Upload counts even when the mission gains nothing**: a timed-out or lost request
  still transmitted bytes. Partial transfers charge proportionally to transfer time.
- **Radio activation energy** is charged on every attempt, including an unreachable
  probe. Communication energy = uploaded_mb x uplink_j_per_mb + downloaded_mb x
  downlink_j_per_mb + activation_j — configured simulation parameters, labelled so.
- **RTT is charged exactly once** per request (a single end-to-end round-trip
  contribution between upload and remote compute); it is never also folded into the
  upload/download terms.
- **Remote failure is not an empty prediction**: a failed request without a fallback
  yields ``success=False`` plus a status/reason, and the runner records it as a failed
  inference — distinguishable end-to-end from a healthy "nothing detected".

Fallback semantics (executor-level, distinct from the ActionValidator's *action*
fallback): if the remote attempt fails and the config names a ``fallback_config_id``,
the named local executor runs **on the same captured frame**; the failed remote
attempt's elapsed time, transmitted bytes, and radio energy remain charged; the
fallback's compute time and energy are added; the result records the full path.
