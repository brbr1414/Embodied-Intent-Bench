"""Time-varying network conditions for V2/V3 missions (V3 P1).

A mission's link is a deterministic, piecewise-constant sequence of **named regimes**
(``5g_good``, ``lte_degraded``, ``disconnected`` …). The runner samples the regime at
defined mission times; the policy sees only the current sample, projected into the
frozen V1 ``NetworkObservation`` (bandwidth/RTT/loss) — never the regime name, the
segment boundaries, or anything about the future. Regime identity exists for
diagnostics and replay only.

Conceptually this is V1's ``TraceBasedNetworkModel`` adapted to V2: the same
piecewise-constant, sampled-at-decision-time semantics, but with separate uplink and
downlink (a remote inference request is upload-heavy) and a regime label. V2 scenarios
without a ``network_trace`` keep their constant network, unchanged.
