"""Deterministic nearest-neighbour resizing of a binary mask onto the GT coordinate system.

A model often runs at a different input resolution than the ground truth was annotated at. Its
output mask must be mapped back to the GT grid before evaluation, and for a *binary* mask the
only correct interpolation is nearest-neighbour -- bilinear would invent fractional occupancy
the pixel set cannot represent. The mapping is integer arithmetic, so it is exactly
reproducible.
