"""UAVid dataset adapter for the real-data pilot (V3 P4).

Reads the **official UAVid distribution layout** (``{split}/{split}/seqN/Images`` +
``seqN/Labels`` with colour-coded semantic PNGs) — real oblique UAV imagery — and
exposes it through the pilot's :class:`DatasetAdapter` boundary.

What the adapter is honest about:

- **License**: UAVid is released for non-commercial academic research (CC BY-NC-SA
  4.0). The dataset never enters this repository; only a local path is consumed.
- **Semantic, not instance, ground truth**: official UAVid labels are per-pixel
  semantic classes ("currently, UAVid only supports image level semantic labelling
  without instance level consideration" — uavid.nl). Person *instances* are therefore
  **derived** as 4-connected components of the ``Humans`` colour (64, 64, 0). The
  derivation is deterministic and recorded in provenance; its known failure mode —
  touching people merge into one component — undercounts adjacent groups and is
  stated, not hidden.
- **No temporal identity**: UAVid keyframes are 10 s apart and carry no track ids, so
  every derived component is its own target (``track_id = "<seq>/<frame>#<n>"``);
  track-level recall degenerates, deliberately and visibly, to per-instance recall.
  Inventing cross-frame identity here would be fabrication.
- **Curation is scope, not leakage**: the pilot evaluates a native-resolution
  **window** of each selected keyframe, centred on the frame's annotated activity,
  and prefers frames of moderate instance density. Both choices happen entirely on
  ground truth the evaluator owns anyway — no model or policy ever sees it — and
  every window origin, clipped instance, and skipped frame is recorded in provenance.
  The window exists because the frozen V1 mask wire format is a dense per-instance
  bitmap: full 4K frames with dense crowds produce multi-gigabyte ground-truth files
  (measured, not hypothetical), while a 1280x720 native window keeps the bundle
  honest *and* writable.
