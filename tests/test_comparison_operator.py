"""Quality-operator comparisons.

The contract's quality constraint and a task's matching rule both hinge on these four
operators, and boundary behaviour decides pass/fail for an entire episode: a run scoring
exactly 0.80 against ``target_f1 >= 0.80`` must succeed. Each operator is pinned at the
boundary for that reason.
